## The Nonviolent and Violent Campaigns and Outcomes visualization

The Nonviolent and Violent Campaigns and Outcomes (NAVCO) data project is the first of its kind to collect systematic data on both violent insurgencies and nonviolent civil resistance campaigns. The coverage is global but is excluded to maximalist campaigns (i.e. those seeking to overthrow an incumbent government, expel a foreign military occupation, or secede). NAVCO now has multiple published versions, as well as several others in progress.
Here I use NAVCO 2.1, the latest version at the moment (May 2022).

The granularity of dataset is campaign-year per row.

Dataset is available at https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/navco
